            Providing accurate information about your venue's wheelchair accessibility is essential

            Please be as descriptive and honest as possible in your responses to avoid any surprises 
            for your visitors. Avoid using subjective terms like "accessible" and instead describe specific 
            features, such as "the entrance is step-free and 90cm wide."
