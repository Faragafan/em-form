            Guided Self-Report Your Venue's Wheelchair Accessibility

            Congratulations on taking the first step towards accessibility and inclusion!
            Providing accurate information about your venue's wheelchair accessibility is
            essential for helping your visitors make informed decisions. This guided form is
            designed to assist you in reporting your venueâ€™s accessibility features in detail.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Please be as descriptive and honest as possible in your responses to avoid any
            surprises for your visitors. Avoid using subjective terms like "accessible" and
            instead describe specific features, such as "the entrance is step-free and 90cm
            wide."
